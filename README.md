- 👋 Hey there, fellow Python enthusiasts and collaborators!
- 👀 Are you someone who loves Python and enjoys helping others learn? Awesome! I'm @nyonicxrr (Ridhwan Ziyadi), and I'm just starting out on my coding journey as a first-year student, studying ICT.
- 🤗 Yep, I'm a beginner, but hey, we all start somewhere, right?
- 🌱 I'm super excited to dive into Python and explore all its possibilities. But you know what would make this journey even better? 
- 💞️ Having a mentor or a buddy to guide me along the way. Whether you're a seasoned pro or someone who's also just getting started like me, let's team up!
- 📫 Together, we can learn, grow, and build some really cool stuff. So, if you're up for it, shoot me an email at ridhwanzyad4144@gmail.com
